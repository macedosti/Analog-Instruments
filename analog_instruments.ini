- Speedo

[SPEED_INDICATOR]
ZERO=0
STEP=1
MIN_VALUE=0
OBJECT_NAME=ARROW_SPEED
OBJECT_NAME_MAX=

ZERO - this is in °, it is the starting position of the arrow, it is best to export arrow model in 0° so you don't need to play with this number and leave it at 0
STEP - this is in °, simple, if you want that 1° represents 1km/h (1mph) you leave this value at 1, if you want 10km/h to be 1° then it should be 0.1, etc. For clockwise movement, it needs to be positive value, for counter clockwise, it needs to be negative
MIN_VALUE - this should represent minimal value shown, for example if you set it to 10, it should not show anything below 10 (input value)
OBJECT_NAME - name of object that represents arrow
OBJECT_NAME_MAX - telltale for the main arrow

- RPM

[RPM_INDICATOR]
ZERO=0
STEP=1
MIN_VALUE=0
OBJECT_NAME=ARROW_RPM
OBJECT_NAME_MAX=
LUT=(0=0|2000=20|4000=40|6000=60)

same as above except in kp/h(mph) it is 1 rpm.
LUT - lut table, left side is value (rpm), right side is ° of movement (good for asymmetric tacho gauge)


- RPM Limiter

[LIMITER_INDICATOR]
ZERO=0
STEP=1
MIN_VALUE=0
OBJECT_NAME=ARROW_LIMITER
OBJECT_NAME_MAX=

same as above
RPM limiter is hard coded, and if 3D object is named ARROW_LIMITER this code is not needed. RPM limiter arrow should be identical copy of RPM arrow, with dummy at same place and same orientation in order to function properly.


- Turbo

[TURBO_INDICATOR_n]
ZERO=0
STEP=100
MIN_VALUE=0
OBJECT_NAME=ARROW_TURBO
USE_BAR=0

USE_BAR - changes units (maybe it is 1 for true, 0 for false, looks like instead of PSI to use BAR etc.)
n in name can be 0, 1, 2...n (for more then 1 turbo)

- Fuel

[FUEL_INDICATOR]
ZERO=0
STEP=1
MIN_VALUE=0
OBJECT_NAME=ARROW_FUEL
LUT=(0=0|20=30|40=60)

LUT - left side is amount in liters, right side is ° of movement (good for asymmetric fuel gauge)


- Water temperature

[WATER_TEMP]
ZERO=0
STEP=1
MIN_VALUE=0
OBJECT_NAME=ARROW_TEMP
LUT=(50=0|90=15|130=30)

LUT - left side is amount in °C, right side is ° of movement (good for asymmetric water temperature gauge)


- Other gagues

[PLACE_HOLDER_n]
ZERO=0
STEP=1
MIN_VALUE=0
OBJECT_NAME=ARROW_OIL_TEMP/ARROW_OIL_PRES

LUT tables are not necessary, so these parts of code are not needed in order for analog_instruments.ini to work. Also when LUT tables are used, STEP and MIN_VALUE are ignored.


- analog_speed_curve.lut

0|0
100|45
200|90

left side is speed in km/h, right side is ° of movement (good for asymmetric speedo gauge), regarding STEP and MIN_VALUE, they are also ignored when this is used.
